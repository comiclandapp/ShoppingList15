import SwiftUI

	// the ModifyExistingItemView is opened via a navigation link from the ShoppingListView
	// or the PurchasedItemTabView to do as it says: edit an existing shopping item.
	//
	// this will be an "almost live edit," in the sense that when the user touches the <Back button,
	// we update the values of the Item with the edited values.  however, because we have to intercept
	// when the user taps the Back button, we'll use our own Back button.  (maybe there's an
	// easier way to intercept tapping the Back button, but i don't have it here right now.)
	//
	// the strategy is simple:
	//
	// -- create an editable representation of values for the item (an ObservableObject)
	// -- the body shows a Form in which the user can edit the default data
	// -- we update the Item's values from the editable representation when going back.
	//
	// one quick thing: this View will also display a confirmation alert if the user wants to delete the Item,
	// and if the user agrees, then we must be sure not to update the Item on the way out (!)
	//
struct ModifyExistingItemView: View {
	
	@Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss: DismissAction
	
		// an editable copy of the Item's data.  it's important that this be a @StateObject, because
		// it is treated somewhat differently in terms of lifecycle that @State.
		// my observations:
		//
		// -- the lifecycle of a @StateObject is not the same as that of the underlying View struct
		//     where it is defined.  it is created lazily by SwiftUI when the View will actually be coming to
		//     the screen, and destroyed when SwiftUI is finished with the View onscreen.  SwiftUI may
		//     or may not destroy the View struct when the @StateObject is destroyed; and if it does not
		//     destroy the View struct, the @StateObject will be restored lazily to its previous value at
		//     the time the SwiftUI view previously left the screen.
		//
		// -- you can say almost exactly the same about an @State struct, but with one major exception:
		//     should a View leave the visual hierarchy (when a @StateObject might be destroyed) without
		//     its underlying struct being similarly destroyed, and should SwiftUI want to bring that View
		//     back into the visual hierarchy, the value of the @State struct will revert to what it was
		//     when the View struct was initialized ... which is not necessarily the same value that the
		//     @State struct had when it previously left the screen.
		//
		// the mysteries of SwiftUI remain for me, even as we're now in version 3.

		// alert trigger item to confirm deletion of an Item
	@State private var confirmDeleteItemAlert: IdentifiableAlertItem?
	
	var body: some View {
		
			// the trailing closure provides the EditableItemDataView with what to do after the user has
			// opted to delete the item, namely "trigger an alert whose destructive action is to delete the
			// Item, and whose destructive completion is to dismiss this view,"
			// so we "go back" up the navigation stack
