import SwiftUI

	// IdentifiableAlertItem is a base class used to trigger alert displays, which in this app,
	// are all "confirmation alerts."  (don't confuse this with iOS 15's confirmationDialog, which
	// uses ActionSheets.)
	// because these are all "are you sure you really want to do this" types of alerts, we will define
	// the base class to have:
	// -- an id, needed to work with .sheet(item: ...)
	// -- title and message for the Alert
	// -- destructive & non-destructive titles and actions
	//        (yes, there could be an action to perform with a "No")
	// -- destructive & non-destructive completion handlers
	//        (depending on the call-site instantiation, there might be something to do when finished ...)
	//
	// in this app, we never actually use the nonDestructiveAction or  nonDestructiveCompletion, but
	// i will say that in another project, there were things to do in special cases when the user declined
	// to take the destructive action.  an example: the user toggles a switch and it becomes necessary to
	// ask the user of they're sure that they want to "turn something off."  by the time the code sees this,
	// the toggle has already been changed, so declining to accept the consequences of turning something
	// off means that you have to restore the toggle's stae.

class IdentifiableAlertItem: Identifiable {
		// must be Identifiable to work with .alert(item: ...)
	var id = UUID()

	var message: String = "Alert message"

	var destructiveTitle: String = "Yes"

	var nonDestructiveAction: (() -> Void)?
	
		// completion handlers for after we do what we do. generally, these
		// will execute view-specific code (dismiss() or an animation?) that is
		// determined at the call site when creating the alert (e.g., not code performed
		// on model data such as deleting a Core Data object)
	var destructiveCompletion: (() -> Void)?
