// This file contains an idea that I am working on, to replace all the deprecated
// .alert(item: ...) modifiers scattered throughout the code by the newer
// .alert( : isPresented: presenting: actions: message:) syntax.  It turns out the idea
// does not quite work ... this newer form still is not a simple, direct replacement
// and still has some quirks.
//
// Nevertheless, I'll leave this file here for now, noting that in the LocationsView and the
// ModifyExistingLocationView you will see some commented out code that should be
// ignored for now until I figure out what's going on.

		// we keep the isPresented variable used to trigger the associated alert
		// right here in the AlertModel and make it @Published.  so potentially
		// a view that uses such an alert has a @StateObject viewModel of type
		// AlertModel and references viewModel.isPresented in the .alert() syntax
	@Published var isPresented = false
	
		// defaults for the String title and a Text for the message.  you will want
		// to set these when you call alertModel.updateAndTrigger()
